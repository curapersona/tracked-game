* Tracked

Tracked is a large-scale role-playing game designed especially for MozFest 2018 that puts you in the shoes of different actors in the internet’s surveillance economy. Players will model the data tracking ecosystem, demonstrating how the data that platforms collect about us is used to personalize, target, or recommend new content to us. Throughout the two days of MozFest, you’ll be invited to complete different activities and challenges in order to score points -- but you’ll also need to move quickly to avoid being tracked.
